            <p><strong>Rosacea</strong> is a chronic skin condition primarily affecting the central parts of the face, such as the cheeks and nose. It is characterized by persistent redness or visible blood vessels near the skin's surface. Symptoms can vary widely among individuals and may include flushing, stinging or burning sensations, small bumps resembling acne, and in severe cases, thickened skin on the nose.</p>

            <h2>How can Rosacea impact your health?</h2>
            <p>Rosacea symptoms can fluctuate over time and may worsen due to environmental triggers. Common effects include persistent redness, irritation of the eyes or eyelids, and psychological impacts such as embarrassment, low self-esteem, anxiety, or depression. Management involves lifestyle adjustments, medications, and light-based therapies to alleviate symptoms, along with emotional support from counseling or support groups.</p>

            <h2>Is Rosacea genetic?</h2>
            <p>Genetics play a role in rosacea, influencing an individual's likelihood of developing the condition. It is believed that many genetic variants collectively contribute to this predisposition. 23andMe evaluates over 14,154 genetic markers to estimate the genetic risk of rosacea. However, genetics are only part of the complex factors involved in rosacea development.</p>
