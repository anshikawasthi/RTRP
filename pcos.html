            <p><strong>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</strong> is a hormone disorder affecting people with ovaries. It is characterized by high testosterone levels, irregular periods, and the presence of more ovarian follicles (polycystic ovaries) than usual. Common symptoms also include weight gain, acne, oily skin, and excess hair growth on the face, chest, or body.</p>

            <h2>How can PCOS impact your health?</h2>
            <p>PCOS increases the risk of infertility and pregnancy-related complications. It is associated with various health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease, and endometrial cancer. Additional symptoms may include sleep apnea, anxiety, and depression.</p>
            <p>Managing PCOS involves healthcare professional consultation for risk assessment and addressing reproductive concerns. While there is no cure, treatments including medications and lifestyle modifications can effectively manage symptoms.</p>

            <h2>Is PCOS genetic?</h2>
            <p>Genetics play a role in PCOS, increasing the likelihood based on familial inheritance. PCOS often runs in families due to a combination of numerous genetic variants, each contributing incrementally to the overall risk. 23andMe considers over 1,300 genetic markers to estimate the likelihood of developing PCOS.</p>

            <h2>How common is PCOS?</h2>
            <p>PCOS affects approximately 10% of females and is a leading cause of female infertility. It is more prevalent among individuals with a family history of the condition. Hormonal birth control can mask symptoms, potentially delaying diagnosis until individuals cease birth control and face challenges with conception.</p>
