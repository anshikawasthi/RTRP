            <h2>Is Depression Genetic?</h2>
            <p>Yes, the likelihood of experiencing depression is influenced by both genetic and non-genetic factors. Depression can run in families, indicating an increased chance if family members have the condition. Over 8,400 genetic markers are considered by 23andMe to estimate the likelihood of being diagnosed with depression.</p>
            <p>Genetics combine with other factors such as health conditions, stressful life events, social isolation, and substance use to influence an individual’s overall likelihood of developing depression.</p>
