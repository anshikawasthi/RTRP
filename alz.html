            <p><strong>What is Alzheimer’s disease and how common is it?</strong> Alzheimer’s disease is a form of dementia. It’s characterized by progressive memory loss, gradual cognitive decline, and personality changes.</p>
            <p>There are two different types of Alzheimer’s disease: late-onset Alzheimer’s disease and early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Both have symptoms that are much the same.</p>

            <h2>Typical signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Memory loss that worsens over time</li>
                <li>Mood and personality changes</li>
                <li>Trouble planning or solving problems</li>
                <li>Confusion with place or time</li>
                <li>Difficulty performing daily life activities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The big difference between the types of Alzheimer’s is the age at which symptoms begin. Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease begins at a younger age, with many people first showing symptoms in their 30s, 40s, or 50s. The early-onset type is more rare, accounting for 1% or less of Alzheimer’s cases. Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form, and symptoms typically begin after age 65.</p>

            <h2>Is Alzheimer’s disease genetic?</h2>
            <p>Yes, genetic factors for Alzheimer’s disease have been identified. The ε4 variant in the APOE gene is the most common genetic variant associated with an increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Having one copy of the ε4 allele increases risk 3-fold, and two copies of ε4 increase risk 8- to 12-fold.</p>
            <p>However, ε4 and APOE are not the only determinants for risk. Other genes and genetic mutations also influence the risk for both late-onset and early-onset forms of Alzheimer’s, alongside non-genetic factors.</p>

            <h2>Alzheimer’s Disease in People with Down Syndrome</h2>
            <p>People with Down syndrome are at a higher risk of developing dementia similar to Alzheimer’s disease, with 50% showing signs by their 60s. This is possibly due to the location of the APP gene on chromosome 21.</p>
            <p>For all individuals, genetic testing is available to identify variants linked to different types of Alzheimer’s disease, and additional genetic factors may be discovered in the future.</p>

        <article>
          
            <h2>Does Alzheimer’s disease run in families?</h2>
            <p>Yes, Alzheimer’s disease can run in families, especially in families with genetic variants linked to early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. People with a parent or sibling with Alzheimer’s are more likely to develop the condition.</p>
            <p>If you have a family history of Alzheimer’s disease or questions about genetic testing for the condition, a genetic counselor may be able to help.</p>

            <h2>What other risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease are there?</h2>
            <p>Non-genetic factors associated with higher or lower risk for Alzheimer’s include age, sex, family history, heart health, diet, exercise, intellectual activity, and race/ethnicity.</p>
            <p>Understanding these factors can help in managing and reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
